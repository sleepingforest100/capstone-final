Suppose
that
you
have
the
following
results
of
survey.Now
it is necessary
to
analyze
obtained
survey
by
using
Simple
Random
Sampling and Stratified
Random
Sampling.Recommended
tool
for using is MS Excel.

(Ignore the fpc and the clustering in calculating the standard error.)

P.S.when
you
are
going
to
write
your
answer
into
answer
sheet, please
round
up
to
2
digits
after
floating
point

1) Assume
that
you
're going to do Simple Random Sampling (SRS) for above dataset.

Compute
a
mean: blank
blank
blank
blank

P.S
here
you
need
to
drag - and -drop
digit - by - digit.For
example,
if your answer is 35.13 then you need to drag 3, then 5, then.and then 1 and 3

2) Compute a standard error for SRS:  blank
blank
blank
blank

3) Now
compute
95 % of
confidence
interval.Please
note
that
t - value in this
case is equal
to
2.04

Upper
limit
for SRS:  blank

Lower
limit
for SRS:  blank

blank
blank

P.S
You
need
to
take
rounded
answers
from

1
st and 2
nd
questions

Now
for Stratified part

1) What is the value of Wh        blank  blank  blank  blank

2) Compute a mean:  blank
blank
blank
blank

3) Compute
a
standard
error
for Stratified part:  blank
blank
blank

4) Compute
d - value: blank
blank
blank
blank
Hint: d - value is a
ratio
of
standard
error
for statified over standard error for SRS
5) Compute d-squared:  blank
blank
blank
blank
6) Compute
Neff
blank
blank
blank
blank
P.S
you
need
to
take
exact
anwer
from

5 - th
step
rounded
up
to
2
digits
after
floating
point.

Suppose
that
you
're going to run neural network algorithm with the following parameters:

Data
Preparation: Normalized
input
vectors
for binary classification.
        Network Architecture: Three
hidden
layers
with ReLU activation, and an output layer with Sigmoid activation.
Forward Propagation: Computes
activations
through
each
layer.
Loss
Calculation: Uses
Mean
Absolute
Error(MAE) as the
loss
function.
Backpropagation: Computes
gradients
using
the
chain
rule.
Weight and Bias
Updates: Updates
parameters
using
gradient
descent
with a learning rate.
Iterative Training: Runs
for 10, 000 epochs, printing loss every 1, 000 epochs.
Final Prediction: Outputs
probability
values
for each input.
        a4 =[blank  blank  blank, blank  blank  blank]

a3.max() =  blank  blank  blank           (round up to  integer value)
